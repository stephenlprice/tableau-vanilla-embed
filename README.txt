A blogging platform, a source of information.
Scalable, user friendly, database driven.
A place to record achievements. The site itself is an extended ramp.
Maybe someday even afford the luxury to share honest opinions on the internet.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
